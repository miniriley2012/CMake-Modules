# CMake Modules

A few CMake Modules I commonly use

## Current Modules
* [FetchGit](FetchGit.cmake) - Downloads and imports a CMake from a git repository
* [ThisProject](ThisProject.cmake) - Sets `THIS_PROJECT` if the current project being built is the root project
* [BuildTest](BuildTest.cmake) - Tests added with `add_build_test` are automatically built when testing
